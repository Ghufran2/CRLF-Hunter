"""
CRLF Hunter package initialization.

This module defines the package version and exposes minimal public API.

The version is defined here to ensure consistency between packaging metadata and
runtime introspection (e.g. ``crlfhunter.__version__``). Update this value
whenever you bump the version in ``setup.py``.
